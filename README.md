The purpose of this repo is the documentation and creation of my personal CV in an automated, data-driven way. The CV is created using the `vitae` package in R, which is a wrapper around the `pagedown` package. The `vitae` package allows for the creation of a CV using R Markdown, which can be rendered to a PDF or HTML file. The `pagedown` package allows for the creation of a CV using HTML and CSS, which can be rendered to a PDF file.
